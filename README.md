Example of implementing tools for the DocDo online system.
Some parameters are purposely empty because they contain information from our servers, so that whoever uses it must set new address information as well as API calls.

Window control and center of the window by the mouse.
Upload files using Rest API requests.
Login screen
Graphical connection interface with pacth orthanc.
